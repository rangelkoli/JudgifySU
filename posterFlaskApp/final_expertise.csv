Michael Blatchley,"4D Biomaterials; Organoids; Vascularization; Extracellular Matrix; Tissue Morphogenesis; My lab’s research focuses on constructing benchtop models of human tissues. We’re really interested in understanding the “rules of life” for how tissues form, so we can use that knowledge to improve the biomimicry of our engineered tissue models to understand the biology of development and disease.; How we do it: We do this by first mining existing datasets and using advanced imaging tools to further our understanding of homeostatic or pathological characteristics of tissue-specific microenvironments. We then take that knowledge, decide what parameter(s) we want to investigate, and engineer inquiry-specific microenvironments using synthetic hydrogels. Some projects focus on how altered initial conditions (e.g., matrix stiffness or viscoelasticity, integrin binding, extracellular matrix composition, and cell composition) impact morphogenesis. Other projects focus on the role of spatiotemporal dynamics of the extracellular microenvironment in shaping growing tissues. For this work, we use light-tunable materials to alter the properties of our synthetic microenvironments, in order to guide morphogenesis. |  | 1.

Kristopher Micinski,"Programming Languages; Static Analysis; Formal Methods; Foundations of Computer Security and Privacy; My research lies at the intersection of the theory and application of program analyses. Program analyses are tools that examine programs and determine (prove) facts about them. For example, a program analysis might prove that a program can never crash due to a type error. In general, however, program analyses can be arbitrarily complex and infer subtle program invariants relating to myriad applications (such as computer security).; Because program analyses must always approximate program behavior (otherwise they could solve the halting problem), there is an inherent tradeoff between analysis precision and analysis performance. Currently, program analyses are often applied only in limited contexts, as gaining acceptable performance requires too many compromises in terms of analysis precision. My current work focuses on three concurrent threads: tackling fundamental issues relating to scaling static analysis (specifically, scaling analyses to run on supercomputers rather than a single machine as all current analyses do); engineering those analyses (to allow analysis reuse); and applying those analyses to computer security (e.g., to check properties such as information flow and to support complex reverse engineering tasks). |  | 1.

Yaoying Wu,"Synthetic Biomaterials; Peptide Assembly; Vaccine Design; Immunoengineering; The immune system is essential for many aspects of human health, such as, infections, autoimmune conditions, malignancies, and tissue regenerations. While the generations of immune responses are complicated processes that involves wide range of molecular and cellular interactions, many key aspects crucial for protective immune responses have been recently revealed, generating enormous opportunities for therapeutic interventions to greatly improve patient health. Various immune engineering strategies based on biomaterial platforms have shown promise in facilitating immunogenic materials trafficking, modulating cellular interactions, and more. My previous work has also demonstrated several approaches to engineer coordinated cellular and humoral immune responses for augmenting therapeutic responses. The research of our team at Syracuse is aimed at designing biomaterials strategies to delivering molecular stimuli in a temporal and spatial fashion for regulating immune functions.
