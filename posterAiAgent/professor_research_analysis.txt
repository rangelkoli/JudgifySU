1. Core Research Areas: Theoretical Computer Science, Foundations of Data Science, Coding Theory, Lattices, Machine Learning, Algorithms for Big Data, Information Theory.

2. Key Publications:  While specific titles and impact factors require accessing his Google Scholar profile directly and analyzing individual publication details,  it is crucial to note that a thorough analysis of his publications is needed to definitively select the 2-3 *most* significant.  His Google Scholar profile will show publications with the highest citation counts, which will be the most impactful papers.  This analysis would involve reviewing the abstract, methodology, and conclusions of each highly-cited publication to assess its contribution to the field.

3. Research Focus: Dr. Gandikota's research centers on the algorithmic foundations of data science and machine learning.  His work blends theoretical computer science concepts (coding theory, lattices) with practical applications in big data and machine learning algorithms.  He investigates efficient and robust methods for data recovery, focusing on algorithms for handling noise and ensuring accuracy in large-scale datasets.  A significant aspect of his research involves understanding the theoretical limits and possibilities of these methods.

4. Recent Work:  Determining current research directions requires accessing his most recent publications (available on his Google Scholar profile and potentially his university website).  This would involve identifying any emerging themes in his recent papers or any ongoing projects mentioned on his departmental website.

5. Notable Contributions:  Specific contributions need to be determined by carefully examining his publications.  Identifying breakthroughs will require a detailed analysis of the impact of his research papers on the wider academic community and whether they have led to substantial advancements in algorithms, techniques, or theoretical understanding within his research areas.  High citation counts can be an indicator, but not a sole determinant, of a notable contribution.
